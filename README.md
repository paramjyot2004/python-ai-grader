# 🌟 AI Models for Python Competence Assessment Research  
## 📝 Project Overview
This research evaluates open-source AI models for their ability to assess student Python programming competence by analyzing code, generating meaningful prompts, and identifying learning gaps without revealing complete solutions.  

## 🧪 Research Plan
**Evaluation Approach:**  
I will systematically evaluate three categories of open-source models: large language models (CodeLlama, StarCoder) 🦙💻, specialized code analysis models (CodeBERT, CodeT5) 🔍, and educational assessment frameworks (PyBryt, AutoGrader) 🎓.  
- The evaluation will focus on CodeLlama-7B-Instruct as the primary model due to its strong code understanding capabilities, open-source availability, and instruction-following design that aligns well with educational prompt generation.  
- Each model will be tested using a curated dataset of 100 Python code samples 📂 across different competency levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced) covering core concepts like data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, and error handling.  
- The assessment will measure each model's ability to identify conceptual gaps, generate scaffolded learning prompts ✨, and provide constructive feedback 🚦 without revealing complete solutions.

**Validation Methodology:**  
The validation process will employ a mixed-methods approach 🔬 combining automated metrics with expert human evaluation 👩‍🏫👨‍🏫.  
- Automated assessment will measure prompt relevance scores, conceptual coverage analysis, and solution revelation detection using custom rubrics 📊.  
- Expert validation will involve 5 experienced Python instructors conducting blind evaluations of model-generated prompts and assessments using standardized pedagogical criteria.  
- A/B testing with a control group of 20 computer science students 🧑‍💻👍 will measure learning effectiveness, comparing traditional feedback against AI-generated prompts.  
- Validation will also include bias detection analysis to ensure fair assessment across different coding styles and approaches, including the distinction between syntactic errors and deeper conceptual misunderstandings.
