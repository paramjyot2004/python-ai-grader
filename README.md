# AI Models for Python Competence Assessment Research

## Project Overview

This research evaluates open-source AI models for their ability to assess student Python programming competence by analyzing code, generating meaningful prompts, and identifying learning gaps without revealing complete solutions.

## Research Plan

**Evaluation Approach:** I will systematically evaluate three categories of open-source models: large language models (CodeLlama, StarCoder), specialized code analysis models (CodeBERT, CodeT5), and educational assessment frameworks (PyBryt, AutoGrader). The evaluation will focus on CodeLlama-7B-Instruct as the primary model due to its strong code understanding capabilities, open-source availability, and instruction-following design that aligns well with educational prompt generation. Each model will be tested using a curated dataset of 100 Python code samples across different competency levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced) covering core concepts like data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, and error handling. The assessment will measure each model's ability to identify conceptual gaps, generate scaffolded learning prompts, and provide constructive feedback without revealing complete solutions.

**Validation Methodology:** The validation process will employ a mixed-methods approach combining automated metrics with expert human evaluation. Automated assessment will measure prompt relevance scores, conceptual coverage analysis, and solution revelation detection using custom rubrics. Expert validation will involve 5 experienced Python instructors conducting blind evaluations of model-generated prompts and assessments using standardized pedagogical criteria. Additionally, I will implement A/B testing with a control group of 20 computer science students to measure learning effectiveness, comparing traditional feedback against AI-generated prompts. The validation will also include bias detection analysis to ensure fair assessment across different coding styles and approaches, with particular attention to identifying whether the model can distinguish between syntactic errors and deeper conceptual misunderstandings.
